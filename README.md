## Description
This is an analysis of trip history data from three different bike share services in the US: Capital Bikeshare, Hubway, and Divvy. The analysis is conducted using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook, utilizing publicly available data from the Capital Bikeshare, Hubway, and Divvy websites. This was done as part of a final project for the "Introduction to Data Mining" class at The George Washington University, instructed by Dr. Nima Zahadat. A readout of the analysis can be found in the file titled, "Bike Share Ridership in the United States.pdf".

Note that on May 9, 2018, Hubway officially changed its name to Blue Bikes. Given that the analysis was conducted prior to the date when the name change took effect, the included materials still refer to Blue Bikes as Hubway.
